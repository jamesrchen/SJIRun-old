### Components

#### Common
docker-compose.yml allows management of both server and client. `.env.local` is used for sensitive environmental variables in development

#### Server
Handles callbacks, authentication, API Data retrieval and updating of DB. Usually hosted on api.domain.tld

#### Client
Just a web interface. Usually hosted on domain.tld

### Building for production

This project is meant to be run using docker containers and placed behind a reverse-proxy like Caddy or NGNIX to facilitate easier SSL Management (hence the lack of any ports exposed outside of linked machines)

#### Instructions:

Clone the repo onto your server

`git clone git@github.com:unknownguy2002/SJIRun.git`

Make sure to fill up .env (example in .sample-env)

`cp .sample-env .env`

To link your services to a reverse proxy or to expose it straight from the container (not recommended), use a `docker-compose.override.yml`. [See more here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/)

Docker compose will build and handle the rest

`docker-compose up`

### Running in development mode
Create `.env.local`, similar to `.sample-env` but with `VITE_` appended to environmental variables that should be exposed to vite.js

Run `./dev.sh`, puts the client into development mode and runs nodemon
